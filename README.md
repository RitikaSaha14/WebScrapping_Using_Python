# Python-Based Web Scraping Application for E-Commerce Data
This project is a Python-based web scraping application designed to extract, structure, and export e-commerce product data from a live website. It demonstrates a complete analytics-style workflow, covering data extraction, validation, visualization, and storage, with an interactive GUI for user-friendly access.
* The application collects product-level information such as:

* Product Name
* Price
* Rating

and makes the data available through:

* GUI-based visualization
* Console output
* CSV file export for further analysis

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* Python 3

* Requests – HTTP requests and data fetching
* BeautifulSoup (bs4) – Parsing unstructured HTML data
* lxml – Efficient HTML parser
* End-to-End Workflow

  E-Commerce Website
→ HTTP Data Fetching (Requests)
→ HTML Parsing (BeautifulSoup, lxml)
→ Data Structuring & Validation
→ Visualization (GUI / Console)
→ CSV Export for Analytics

* Key Features
  
* Extracts structured data from unstructured web pages
* Validates and formats scraped data
* Interactive Tkinter GUI for tabular display
* Console-based data inspection
* CSV output for downstream analysis (Excel / BI tools)
* Tkinter – GUI-based data visualization
* CSV – Structured data storage

  -> Project Output

* CSV File: Clean, structured dataset ready for analysis
* GUI Table: User-friendly visualization of extracted data
* Console Output: Quick tabular view for debugging and validation
